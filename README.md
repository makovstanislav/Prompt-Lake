## Prompt Lake: A Next.js Capstone Project

This repository contains the capstone project for my CV. It's built using Next.js and bootstrapped with create-next-app【9†source】.

### Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`. Alternatively, you can use `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev`.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

Feel free to start editing the homepage by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you make changes to the file.

The project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font【9†source】.
